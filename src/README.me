The is the repo for the final project for ECE 3140 which contains the inertial measurement unit (IMU) using an accelerometer and magnetometer along with a visualizer. 
To run, compile and flash the IMU program in 'src' to the FRDM K64F board. 
Then run the Python visualizer which will open up a GUI and a figure that captures the board's orientation. 
Note that the yaw/magnetometer values are noisy so the figure will rotate around its Z-axis with noise. 
The user can also read the orientation values through a serial console such as PuTTY along with the python notebook.
